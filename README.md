# My solutions to C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition

These are my solutions to the book's proposed projects and exercises. They are
somewhat old, and since I didn't know programming before reading the book, I
might have used questionable practices and some programs might not work
perfectly.

If there's any kind of problem such as code that doesn't work at all or files
placed in the wrong folders, let me know.

I hope this can be useful for someone.
